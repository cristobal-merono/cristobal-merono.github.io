Associate Professor (Profesor Contratado Doctor) at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. I belong to the [M^2ASAI](https://dcain.etsin.upm.es/m2asai/) research group at UPM. I am also a member of the research team of the project [AGAPI](https://dcain.etsin.upm.es/agapi/index.html).

<strong> Research: </strong>

My main research interests lie in Inverse Problems for Partial Differential Equations, specially in Inverse Scattering and the Calderón Problem. 

<strong> Calderón Problem: </strong>

The Calderón Problem is the mathematical model of [Electrical Impedance Tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance_tomography) or EIT. This problem consists in the reconstruction of the conductivity inside a conductor from measurements of voltages and electrical currents made at the boundary of the conductor.  I am currently interested in the development of effective reconstruction algorithms using techniques from scattering theory like the Born approximation. One of the main challenges is to rigorously define this mathematical object in the case of ill- posed problems like the Calderón problem. For recent results in the radial case see this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06321).
